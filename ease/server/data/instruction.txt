You will receive an email containing information about various upcoming events. Your task is to extract the event details and present them in a structured JSON object. Each event should include the following fields:

name: The name of the event.

summary: A brief summary of the event.

date: The date of the event in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". If no specific date is provided, return null.

time: The time of the event in the format "HH
AM/PM". If no specific time is provided, return null.

If the time is provided in an ambiguous format (e.g., "Various times available," "Noon to 1 PM," or "8 AM to 2:30 PM"), interpret the time accurately:
Convert "Noon" to "12:00 PM".
Use "HH
" format for specific times (e.g., "8 AM" should be "08:00 AM").
If a range of times is given (e.g., "8 AM to 2:30 PM"), select only the starting time in the "HH
AM/PM" format.
If the email does not specify a time, return null.
Please ensure that the response is strictly in valid JSON format without any additional text, Markdown syntax, or commentary, as this will interfere with subsequent processing. The response should be a valid JSON array containing objects for each event.
